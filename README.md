Background
Everyone loves delicious food. Today people would like to know what they actually eat in order to keep healthy. That’s why I am going to build this JavaScript Project about food nutrition analysis. This Project is a website that provides nutrition information about some representative food with a corresponding random food picture.

Functionality & MVPs
The website has the following features: 

1)  The default page shows the picture of question mark made up by food.
2)  Each time clicked a random food picture will be present.
3)  The nutrition information includes calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates and fiber. 
4)  The 5 most frequently used contents of the food will be present.
5)  Allow users to register to save and review the information they searched (bonus).

1)  Nav links include links to the project’s Github repo and my LinkedIn.
2)  The default page covers all the four boxes with a question mark picture
3)  Once button clicked, a random picture is inside top left box
4)  The name linked to the food’s wiki page and calories range are inside the top right box.
5)  A bar graph is inside the bottom left box, with minimum, maximum, average and media data of each nutrient.
6)  5 most frequently used contents is inside the bottom right box with a form of donut graph.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

1)	The Chart.js libary to render the materials of the food.
2)	The APIs “Edaman nutrition”, “Foodish” to handle food informations.
3)	The Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code.

Implementation Timeline
Before Monday: Review the lectures during the JS curriculum. Setup project, including getting webpack up and running, set the board the box classes. Get familiar with APIs and the libraries.

Monday: Set the default webpage appropriately. Implement the logic of screening food contents according to the frequency. Ensure that the library can be properly referred when doing the screening.

Tuesday: make sure I can generate graphs appropriately and show the information of selected food contents can be shown appropriately once clicked. 

Wednesday: focus on styling. Use the CSS animation to decorate the webpage and set the action of each element properly.

Thursday: Deploy to GitHub pages. Rewrite this proposal as a production README.

If time: Create the backend part such as user login and authentication.
